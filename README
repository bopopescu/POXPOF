POXPOF is a POX based POF controller.

POX is a networking software platform written in Python

POX officially requires Python 2.7 (though much of it will work fine
fine with Python 2.6), and should run under Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.
(And just about anywhere else -- we've run it on Android phones,
under FreeBSD, Haiku, and elsewhere.  All you need is Python!)
You can place a pypy distribution alongside pox.py (in a directory
named "pypy"), and POX will run with pypy (this can be a significant
performance boost!).

POX currently communicates with OpenFlow 1.0 switches and includes
special support for the Open vSwitch/Nicira extensions.

pox.py boots up POX. It takes a list of module names on the command line,
locates the modules, calls their launch() function (if it exists), and
then transitions to the "up" state.

POXPOF currently communicates with POF switches (Huawei NE40E-X3 or 
software switch 1.4.0)

pofmanager is the main interface of POXPOF, thus you can call functions
in pofmangager by core.PofManager.

pox.py also supports a few command line options of its own which should
be given first:
 --verbose      print stack traces for initialization exceptions
